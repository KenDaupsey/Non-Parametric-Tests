Two-Sample Tests Non-Parametric in Python

This repository contains a comprehensive report on various two-sample tests implemented using Python. The report covers a wide range of statistical tests, including parametric and non-parametric methods, along with their interpretations and visualizations.

 Contents

The report includes the following sections:

1. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**: A non-parametric test for comparing two related samples, particularly when the data is not normally distributed.

2. **Sign Test**: A non-parametric test for assessing the median difference between paired observations.

3. **Binomial Test**: A test for comparing the observed number of successes to the expected number of successes in a binary outcome.

4. **McNemar Test**: A test for determining if there is a significant change in a binary outcome between two related samples.

5. **Mann-Whitney U Test**: A non-parametric test for comparing the medians of two independent samples.

6. **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: A non-parametric test for comparing the medians of three or more independent samples.

7. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test**: A test for comparing the cumulative distribution functions of two datasets or assessing the goodness-of-fit to a theoretical distribution.

8. **Friedman Test**: A non-parametric test for determining if there are significant differences among multiple related groups.

 Data Sources

The report utilizes datasets from various sources, including:
